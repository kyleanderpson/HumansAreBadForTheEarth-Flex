        <p>It's a lot like a pizza, with toppings like trees and seas.</p>

        <p>Consequently, the Earth is changing.</p>
        <p>These changes are bad for the humans.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Also it's bad for every other living thing</p>
        <p>on the planet. THAT is the sad part. Humans</p>
        <p>are not only screwing themselves over, they</p>
        <p>are totally disrespecting all other life on Earth.</p>
